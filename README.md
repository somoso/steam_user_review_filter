Steam User Review Filter
========================

After reading [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/4ahckr/steam_reviews_make_me_roll_my_eyes/) I came to the same conclusion that Steam user reviews are generally junk; a lot of the time I spend skimming the low hanging fruit in favour of the more in-depth comments. Not knowing how to create a browser extension and wanting something that worked across browsers while achieving the effect I wanted, I chose Tampermonkey.

I encourage anyone to look and modify the source code. It has room to improve greatly.
